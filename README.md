# ChurchStats
First project(!) meant to strengthen html, css and javascript skills. (Leaving up for sentimental value) :)

Church Stats is a simple web app that"
  (1) receives user input about a particular worship service
  (2) retrieves input with event listener (submit) and...
  (3) writes user input into separate div.
  
The purpose of this project is to strengthen my skills in html, css, javascript and github. No frameworks were utilized
in the making of theis project (as though that weren't totally obvious),
