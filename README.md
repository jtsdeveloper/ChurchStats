# ChurchStats
First project meant to strengthen html, css, javascript skills.

Church Stats is a simple web app that"
  (1) receives user input about a particular worship service
  (2) uses submit button to pass form data into Javascript function
  (3) writes user input into separate div
  
The purpose of this project is to strengthen my skills in html, css, javascript and github. No frameworks were utilized
in the making of theis project (as though that weren't totally obvious),

Note: As of first commit, javascript has not been written as I have not yet learned event handlers (at least well enough to 
utilize them at this state). Will bring app to full functionality soon!
